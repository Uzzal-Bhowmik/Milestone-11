   - MongoDB data layering structure: 

	Certainly! MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, schema-less format. Understanding the basic structures within MongoDB, including databases, collections, and documents, is crucial to working with the database effectively.

Here's a detailed explanation of each of these structures:

1. **Database**:
   - In MongoDB, a database is a high-level container for data. It's roughly analogous to a traditional relational database.
   - Databases are the top-level organizational units that store collections of related data.
   - You can have multiple databases within a MongoDB server, each serving a different purpose or application.

2. **Collection**:
   - A collection is a group of documents. Think of it as similar to a table in a relational database.
   - Collections store data records, which are the actual objects or pieces of data you work with in MongoDB.
   - Collections do not enforce a specific schema; each document in a collection can have a different structure, which is one of MongoDB's key features.

3. **Document**:
   - A document is a single data record in MongoDB, and it's similar to a row in a table in a relational database.
   - Documents are stored in JSON-like format, which consists of key-value pairs.
   - They can contain various types of data, including strings, numbers, arrays, embedded documents, and more.
   - MongoDB uses BSON (Binary JSON) format to store documents efficiently, making it suitable for a wide range of data types.

Here's how these structures are layered upon each other:

- You typically have multiple databases within a MongoDB server, each containing a specific set of related collections.

- Each collection stores multiple documents. While documents in a collection are related in some way (e.g., they belong to the same entity or category), they do not have to follow a rigid structure.

- Documents contain data fields. The keys in a document are the field names, and the values can be any valid data type, including other documents or arrays of documents.

Here's a basic example to illustrate this structure:

Suppose you're building a blog platform:

- You might have a `blog` database that contains collections such as `posts`, `authors`, and `comments`.

- The `posts` collection stores individual blog posts, with each document representing a single post.

- A document in the `posts` collection might have fields like `title`, `content`, `author`, and `date`.

- The `authors` collection stores information about the authors of the blog posts.

- A document in the `authors` collection might have fields like `name`, `email`, and `bio`.

- The `comments` collection stores comments on the blog posts.

- A document in the `comments` collection might have fields like `text`, `author`, `post_id`, and `date`.

This flexible, schema-less structure allows you to adapt to changing data requirements and easily manage complex data models. However, it also places the responsibility on your application to ensure data consistency and structure as needed.

##### Module 71

	- JWT Token or JSON Web Token is a secured form of transmitting data from server to client.
	- JWT is usually pronounced as 'JOT' Token
	- JWT token consists of 3 parts : Headers, Payload, Signature
	- JWT token is basically used for Authorizationation i.e. when the user Authenticates using email and password he can access 	client side data but to access the server side he has to authorize. And to do that JWT is an internationally recognized way.

	** There are 2 main ways of storing the JWT token provided by the server to the client. The client needs to store it somewhere 	to use it later. The ways are: 
		1> LocalStorage	
		2> Browser HTTP Only Cookies.

	- The latter method is bit more secured than the first one although both are not 100% safe.
